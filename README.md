# ud.sh
Custom update script for Linux systems 🐧

This is a script I have used to update and upgrade packages on my Linux systems since I first began using Linux!

I have tweaked it many times over the years and will likely tweak it more in the future.

I should have created a Git repo for this years ago, but I'm doing it now. :P

## What does this script update?

- APT
- Flatpak
- Homebrew (Linux Version)
- NPM

**Plus there are ***fancy*** colors!**

(*I will likely add more additions in the future...*)
